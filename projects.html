		<h1>My Projects</h1>
		<h2 id="dataScience">Data Science Projects</h2>
		<section><h3><a href="./data_science/final.html">Professional League of Legends data analysis</a></h3>
			<p>For this study on professional League of Legends I gathered and analyzed information the League of Legends pro scene to determine the most prevalent trends in this multi-million-dollar industry. I also used machine learning to make a model of the most influential variables for predicting who would win a match.</p>
		</section>
		<section><h3><a href="./data_science/solar.html">Solar flare data scraping</a></h3>
			<p>In this project I compare the data on solar flares on an official NASA website with another site to create a more extensive and accurate database.</p>
		</section>
		<section><h3><a href="./data_science/life_expectancy.html">A study on life expectancy vs time</a></h3>
			<p>Using gapminder data on life expectancy across several countries I study trends in life expectancy over time and the interaction between time and country.</p>
		</section>
		<h2 id="webDev">Web Development Projects</h2>
		<section>
			<h3><a href="https://github.com/WilliamWeihnacht/Ticket-Client">Ticket Client</a></h3>
			<p>This React/Node/MongoDB web app is a class project I created that models the frontend/server/database structure of a website by allowing a user to create edit and delete a genereic ticket object from a database.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3><a href="sampleForm/research.html">Sample form</a></h3>
			<p>A simple Javascript form I made for class. There is server code to go with it but it isn't hosted.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3><a href="https://github.com/BaySchoolCS2/ProjectRepo">Whirpl</a></h3>
			<p>A website I worked on along with peers to create an anonymous messaging board akin to the ubiquitous YikYak/Whisper with the added restriction that it is only available to students at my school. We used a waterfall methodology along with Git to create and add features and fix bugs.</p>
		</section>
		<h2 id="imageProcessing">Computer Vision Projects</h2>
		<section><h3><a href="https://github.com/WilliamWeihnacht/GMM-color-segmentation">Gaussian Color Segmentation</a></h3>
			<p>In this project I used both a single Gaussian and Gaussian mixture model to train a classifier to identify an orange ball in a series of images where the ball is placed at different distances and subsequently estimate those differences. This project was developed for use by the school robotics team.</p>

		<section><h3><a href="https://github.com/WilliamWeihnacht/Harris-corner-detection/blob/113d7ce8e42cc3aa2314762bc625297aedddc531/myharris.m">Harris corner detection</a></h3>
			<p>This Matlab script uses the Harris corner detection to find corners in images.</p>
